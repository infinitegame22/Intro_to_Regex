original object unless inside the method used that will mutate the original object but generally speacking

Ruby creates a copy of the object before passing it into the object.

Object passing - pass by reference, pass by value, pass by reference value.  

Why immutable objects one way

pass by object_id

- had thought that when passing an argument/object into a method 
- Ruby creates a copy of the object before passing it in
  `- in turn, the 
  - within the method definition upcase! that will affect the original object

  What does Ruby actually do to the object before passing it into a method?

  Dogs and leashes - 

  I have a leash and a dog on my leash. An example of a mutation is to change the hair color.

  Pass the value of my dog to. I would clone the dog and Trisha would have her own dog.  Make a copy and give to someone else

  Pass by reference, I hand the leash to Trisha and she now has the ability to change the hair color.  

  Pass by reference value, I put a new leash on the dog and I give it to you. Both pointers to the same object.  We can both change the color of the dog's fur.  Also have my own pointer to hte same object and mutations by either of us will affect hte same object.  

  The way that numbers behave by pass by value.  There is now way to change a number.  1.upcase does not exist.  I can mutate an array.  Everything operates as pass by reference value.  And some objects cannot be mutated. 

  What is this reference value we are passing.  An object has some identifier.  This object_id or memory address, so I can now link to that same object.  I'm passing you this object identified by information . 

  If we're both pointing to hte same array.  I cna use index assignemtn to adjust one of those elements because I have pointers that point to the same elemtns.

  Pass by reference, different than pass by reference value.  I give my leash.  

  Everything is pass by reference value.  I am always passing you the information you can use ot point there. I am always giving you instructions on how to reach it and link to there.  Call it passing a copy of the reference.  I am passing a copy of the leash.  The leash is the object id.  

  With immutable object, it behaves like pass by value. WIth mutable objects ,it behaves like pass by reference.  

  Ruby always is pass by reference value.

  object_id method can distinguish whether or not these are pointing to the same objects.  

```Ruby
a = [1, 3]
b = [2]

arr = [a, b] # => [[1, 3], [2]]

a[1] = 5 # => a = [1, 5]

p arr # => [[1, 5], [2]]
```
`a` is pointing to the array object, affects array object created on line 1.  Access `a` it will reflect that mutation.  Variables as pointers, so the first element of `arr` is pointing to the array object

```Ruby
def increment(x)
  x << 'b' 
end
y = 'a'
increment(y)
puts y # => 'ab'
```

On line 5 we are passing in the object itself.  Not a copy.  Within the function increment, now we have a local variable x that is pointing to the same string object.

Reassignment 

passing has already been 
line 2 is reassignment
line 3 is mutation

line 6 is passing methods

```Ruby

def test(str)
  str += '!'
  str.downcase!
end
test_str = 'Written Assessment'
test(test_str)
puts test_str
```

method definition for `test` which passes in the variable str we pass in the string object test_str points to.   `str` is reassigned 

`str` is reassigned to `str` as a new object with a '!'

```Ruby

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

p (array.select do |num|
  num.odd?
  num + 1
end)

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

new_array = arr.select do |n|
  n + 1
  puts n # => last evaluated expression of the block is nil so the nothing will be kept, and will return an empty array
end

p new_array

arr = [[1, 999], [5, 777], [10, 888]]

p(arr.sort_by do |array| #specify what item I want to sort by, not automatic sort - imm. sort by element 0.
  array[1]
end) #=> [[5, 777], [10, 888], [1, 999]]

arr.sort do |a, b|
 # a <=> b
 # a > b => 1
 # a < b => -1
 # a == b => 0
  a[1] <=> b[1]
end

words = %w(jump trip laugh run talk)

new_array = words.map do |word|
  word.start_with?("t")
end

p new_array

=begin
based on the return value of the block, booleans are replacing the elements in the original array.

Big 3:
each
map - transformation, return value of block -> store in new array
select
=end

a = "hello"
p([1, 2, 3].map { |num| a }) #=> ['hello', 'hello', 'hello'], collection and variable scope
```
What is variable scope and why do we need to know it?  Knowing which variable is local to which block, where it's available and where we can access it.  Compare blocks and methods rules:
1. With methods, they have a self-contained scope.
  - we can only access variables outside the method scope only if they are passed in as arguments to the method
2. Blocks, variables that are initialized in the outer scope can be accessed by the inner scope but not vice versa.

```Ruby
loop do
  a = 1
  break
end

loop do
  puts a
  break
end
```

on line 2 variable `a` is local to the scope of the first loop.  

```Ruby
animal = "dog"

loop do |_|
  animal = "cat"
  var = "ball"
  break
end

puts animal # => cat
puts var # => Error
```
Outer trying to access inner, `_` represents an unused parameter

```Ruby
def example(str)
  i = 3
  loop do
    puts str
    i -= 1
    break 'goodbye' if i == 0
  end
end

example('hello')
# hello
# hello
# hello
# => 'goodbye'
```
