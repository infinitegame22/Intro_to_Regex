Spencer is in Toronto area Kingston, Ontario. Student TA, just finished the back end portion.  Starting on JS front end portion
Fallon - northwest corner of WA. Currently in RB 101 Lesson 2.  

Smaller session than usual.  Opportunity to ask questions. Speak up with questions.  Ask any questions to field.  As useful as possible.  

She's heard all about PEDAC.  

What is PEDAC?
- problem solving approach necessary for securing a job as a SE
- disciplined, structural approach to solving programming problems 
- First process the problem (PEDA), then code with intent (C)

Benefits:
- Will save us time in the long run
- Will help us avoid issues that often arise when we encounter a problem and try and jump straight to coding (i.e. hack and slash coding)
- Failure to meet requirements of the problem 
- Failure to handle edge cases appropriately
- Resulting solution is hard to read or maintain

*********
I have interviewed five software engineering candidates over the past two weeks, including folks with grad degrees in computer science/ex-FAANG with 7+ years of experience. All five were jointly rejected by myself and a co-interviewer either because the candidates jumped straight into implementation and ended up with bugs during testing or unhandled edge cases, and/or their oral-written communication was poor.

LS curriculum is highly tailored to getting the job we desire.  This is introduced early on in the curriculum where the exercise problems aren't that complicated.  We talk about PEDAC much more in depth later in the curriculum.  First parts of PEDAC seem forced at this point.  Examples and test cases = we are given the examples. Data structure before algorithm? It doesn't seem necessary.  When we are interviewing as SE's we will be expected to do PEDAC process.  These are useful tools to use during my SE career.  PEDAC is not something just to get by.  The more comfortable I am with PEDAC, the better I will do.

It really is a tool.  It takes some breaking in.  A pair of gloves, pair of shoes, mental blisters, bumpy. When we do use it enough it becomes natural.  I'll just pasted in my PEDAC template.  Something to work instead of a blank page.

Make it my own.  I don't have to use it exactly as it was when i was introduces.  Useful to represent a problem and building up that understanding.  Create subsections and swap things around.  It shouldn't feel forced.  It shouldn't be the case where I am thinking, am I doing PEDAC correctly?  It's not about doing PEDAC.  PEDAC is a way of solving the problem with a template.  If it's not useful, skip it.  If the explicit problem statement is easy.

A thorough breakdown of the problem and build up to the solution.  

*Benefits:*
- it does save time in the long run
- when the problems become difficult, PEDAC will help me save time

*Common Mistakes*
- Not enough time spent parsing the problem
- Assumptions about the solution
- Fuzzy algorithm
- Lack of flexibility
- Lack of syntax fluency


So, for those folks who are 'PEDACing' for the first few times:
1) Train your problem solving muscles to start with PEDAC by default (or some equivalent thereof);
2) Get comfortable talking through problems out loud, not just typing silently.

Can't stress enough that PEDAC isn't an arbitrary heuristic meant for getting through the curriculum or 109/129 oral assessments. PEDAC works, especially under pressure.

** PEDAC - people need to feel flexible with PEDAC.  Perfectly natural to wonder whether an algorithm is working.  Some sort of ripple effect. GO back to the algorithm and think about it from the algo.  Use irb; bounce around. It should be a living, breathing thing.  Any misunderstandings cascade into other parts.

Write down the gut feeling.  Don't forget about it.  Do a thorough breakdown of the problem.  Both implicit/explicit rules.  

Consider the word "abode". We can see that the letter a is in position 1 and b is in position 2. In the alphabet, a and b are also in positions 1 and 2. Notice also that d and e in abode occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions 4 and 5.

Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alphabet for each word. 

Expliciet requirements above are quite clear.  Then when we look at the test cases, usually there are some implicit rules.  LS will definitely have implicit rules.  What that means is that there are things I am required to do in order to create teh colution that are not told me look at the test cases to figure it out.

# p symm(["abode","ABc","xyzD"]) == [4, 3, 1]
# p symm(["abide","ABc","xyz"]) == [4, 3, 0]
# p symm(["IAMDEFANDJKL","thedefgh","xyzDEFghijabc"]) == [6, 5, 7]
# p symm(["encode","abc","xyzD","ABmD"]) == [1, 3, 1, 3]
# p symm([]) == nil

For 109 interviews, useful to hear, successful students take time to break down both the explicit and the implicit.  Go through test cases in detail.  It's like brushing your teeth, just do it.

Deferring problem solving to the point where we are coding.  Array.each and trying to put in the conditional.  What he likes to do in his algo, broad statement at the top.
- what do i want to do?
- what step do I want to take to get to the solution

#--------- Algo
Separate the strings from special characters
Iterate through the collection
  push alphabe chars into a new array
    how identify alpha chars?
      check 
- play in irb, see how "a" is differentiated from "@".

# ----- Algo
# Separate the strings from special characters
  # Iterate through the collection
    # Push alphabet chars into a new array
      # How identify alpha chars?
        # Check

# Then capitalize the strings and turn them into num equivalent
```Ruby
=begin
Write a method that takes an array of consecutive letters as input and returns the missing letter.
=end
# p determine_missing_letter(['a','b','c','d','f']) == 'e' 
# p determine_missing_letter(['O','Q','R','S']) == 'P'
# p determine_missing_letter(["a","b","c","d","f"]) == "e"
# p determine_missing_letter(["O","Q","R","S"]) == "P"
```

A clear understanding-
problem section - surgeon, what are its constituent parts?
understanding the test cases, what is doing on?
test cases = architect, bluepring, logit that will pass all the test cases.
- if while I'm building, I go back to the algo and adjust the blueprint.
- algo doesn't have to have more than it needs
- hazard on the side of more detail
- usu. there is one part of a problem/crux. how am I going to get a list of the sub strings from this array?
- time constraint, skip the P part
- check all the substrings from teh given string
Abstractly understand the problem. Better to work these things out.  While it may seem clear at the time?

15 lines later, and coding...look back at the algo, and it didn't include this detail.  Add some details. Interviews are stressful.  Make a note of the algo as a point of reference.  Let it be the process of coming up with a solution.  

```Ruby
=begin
# -------------------------------------- Problem ----------------------------
Goal
- input: array of string characters (non-empty)
- output: character that is missing in the alphabetical order
Presented with an array of consecutive characters, return the missing letter in the sequence.

Rules
- if it's uppercase, we need to return uppercase

# -------------------------------------- Understand
  Examples and Test cases
 -------------------------
Model
['a','b','c','d','f'] == 'e'
'a','b','c','d','e', 'f'

Abstract
 

# -------------------------------------- 
Algorithm
 ------------------------------
 - Compare the given array against our own array of a through z
 - reverse engineer, the character missing is what we want.
  - start at same letter in comparison array
    - find the index in alpha array where element matches index 0 of given array
  - Iterate through the alphay array
    - if letter exists in given_array
      -next
    - if it does not exist
      - return value at that index
# -------------------------------------- Scratchpad

 ------------------------------
 As I use PEDAC more, as I am breaking down the problem.  Instead of stopping
 - IDEA! great idea!
  - zip
  - combination
  - string comparison with >
  - 
=end

def determine_missing_letter(arr)
  alphabet = (arr[0]..arr[-1]).to_a
  alphabet.select { |element| !arr.include?(element) }.join
end

```

Coming up with an algo, writing out the pseudocode, do you spend time assessing whether or not there is a built-in method for certain things. If I'm writing out my algo, and I know a and b and can be compared to each other with a boolean and iterate through that and compare it to that.  How much time do you think, is there already a method that can do this?  What's already available in your mental library?

What's the difference? Interview vs. working at home. Best practice is to come up with working solution. doesn't have to be pretty. Then we can refactor and it could be a one liner. New programmers tend to over design or make solutions overly cleaver.  Generally in a real working situation clarity is more prized to be more readable, not more logic dense.  What is it improving?  Does it feel novel?  Does it save us a lot of time?  Which one would I rather read? An obscre method, or a simple, but clear type of iteration . That type of clarity is seomthing to thinkg aout in general.  Method hunting may not yield anything.  THere are number of methods that I'm aware of. Maybe something in my mind. write on scratchpad.

Instead of running the code to see what it returns.  Use irb to test and then use it once I understand what it returns.

Live interview, docs are not allowed.  Method hunting is rarely going to work.  Method hunting is recommended to some degree.  CodeWars - see other people's solutions.  Working through problems on my own.  What I've also done, go to docs, and look through the methods, find the interesting ones and play around with it.

For every problem, there will some sort of iteration
- each
- each with index
- map
- select
- Enumerable: map.with_index
- upto, downto
- sub
- gsub
- nice repertoire - bring your toolbox and work with what you got

Allowed to have notes on paper with me on the table.  What he might do is sort of just 

Interviews are stressful.  Clock is ticking away.  Not a lot of time to read through documentation.  Not designed for only one method that gets thorugh the complicated part of it.  Have a list of method names written out on a piece of paper with me.  Don't forget the methods I know.  THere are a lot of methods and are not all used that frequently.  Wnat to attain awareness of a certain number.  Combination twice in my head.  All I need to do is see the type of problem, recall combination and have a general understanding of it.  Should be good enough. 

If I'm gonna use a method know what it does.  Just be very familiar iwth the method I do use. If I use a method that I am not familiar with test it out.  Go out of my way to learn the methods.  If I know them and they work, they can save a lot of time.  Not so logic dense that will be required.  

The interviews are more about all of these things we would have prepared prior to taking an assesssment and it's chekcing all these things wehre I can draw on them in a sitaution like this because they are in my working memory.  

109 prep big study guide, lots of exercise problems.  Focus more energy on the written assessment.  Focus on that.  Get used to it.  By the time I do get to the live assessment.  

Passing a pointer.  

With methods, when we're passing an argument within that method that parameter becomes a local variable in that method. If we mutate that, does it mutate the object outside of the method.  The outcome determines the pass by value or pass by reference.  How is it applied to actual user methods. Assignments that create programs that become larger and larger.  Solving problems, don't focus so much - understand what is happening in the code line by line in terms of readability.  Can an integer be mutated?  Can a string be mutated?  If we duplicate the array are the elements inside the same or are they also different.  The whole point is to understand what I'm doing with mutation.  Play with methods.  What happens when I try different things.  PBR and PBV.  It becomes useful to read it and apply it to what I have understood.  

Whenever I get to a new course, look through the forums and see the past answers from TA's.  Way to help students understand what is happening line by line.  When the code is being run, I need a precise understanding of what is happening line by line.  PBR is compared 

https://launchschool.medium.com/variable-references-and-mutability-of-ruby-objects-4046bd5b6717
Mutable objects, on the otehr hand, can always be mutated simply by calling one of their mutating methods. They act like Ruby passes them around by reference; it isn't necessary for a method to mutate an object that is passed by reference, only that it can mutate the object. As I'll recall, pass by reference means that only a reference to an object is passed around; the variables used inside a method are bound to the original objects. This means that the method is free to mutate those objects.  Once again, this isn't completely accurate, but it is helful.

```Ruby
def append(s)
  s << '*'
end

t = 'abc'
puts append(t) # prints abc*
puts t         # prints abc*
```
Here, the string object `abc` is mutable. I can reasonably say that the object referenced by `t` is mutated by `#append` since `t`'s value is passed by reference to `#append` where it is bound to variable `s`. When we apply the `<<` operator to `s`, the change is reflected through `t` as well.  Upon return from the method, the value of `t` has been mutated.  However, `t` still points to the same object in memory; it merely has a different value.
